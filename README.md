[01:00.85] He'd like to come and meet us
[01:03.20] But he thinks he'd blow our minds
[01:05.52] There's a starman waiting in the sky
[01:10.42] He's told us not to blow it
[01:12.75] 'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
[01:14.72] He told me:
[01:16.26] Let the children lose it
[01:18.50] Let the children use it
[01:21.09] Let all the children boogie
